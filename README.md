# South Asia Population Analysis Dashboard  

## Overview  
This is my first Power BI dashboard, visualizing population-related data from 8 South Asian countries between 2000 and 2023. The project aims to analyze and present insights into:  
- Total and average population growth across South Asia.  
- Country-wise population trends.  
- Rural vs. urban population variations.  
- Infant mortality rate changes over time.  
- Tooltip-enabled unemployment variation insights displayed on the urban vs. rural population pie chart.  

## Dashboard Features  
1. **Population Growth Analysis**:  
   - Total population growth across all countries.  
   - Country-specific population growth trends.  

2. **Scatter Plot**:  
   - Visual representation of population growth trends.  

3. **Urban vs. Rural Population Variations**:  
   - A pie chart comparing urban and rural population shares.  
   - Tooltip: Displays unemployment variations over time when hovered over.  

4. **Infant Mortality Trends**:  
   - Line chart showing how infant mortality rates have changed over time.  

## Data  
The dataset focuses solely on population-related metrics, extracted from publicly available sources.  

## How to Use  
1. Download the `.pbix` file and open it with Power BI Desktop.  
2. Interact with the dashboard to explore data insights.  

## Acknowledgments  
This project represents my initial exploration of Power BI. While simple, it serves as a stepping stone for future data visualization endeavors. Constructive feedback is welcome!
